 Assignment for TSN2101 Operating System 

Simulation of CPU scheduling algorithms
Process Scheduling

Process Scheduling algorithms: Do 3 scheduling algorithms
a) Round Robin with Quantum 3
b) Preemptive SJF
c) Non Preemptive SJF
d) Preemptive Priority
e) Non Preemptive Priority

Pre-assigned case
1. User should be able to enter the details about the processes such as Arrival Time, Burst Time,
Priority, Time Quantum for Round Robin assigned at the beginning of simulation and the
number of processes can range from 3 to 10.
2. Executing the program should show the Gantt chart (visual form) of each algorithm.
3. Calculation of
a) Turnaround time for each process
b) Total and Average Turnaround time for the entire processes 
c) Average Waiting time for each process
d) Total and Average Waiting time for the entire processes
